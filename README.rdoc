== README

This is a pretty straightforward example of a Rails app with a bit of an API component. Inspired by the book http://www.amazon.com/Flavor-Bible-Essential-Creativity-Imaginative/dp/0316118400/ . You can define food relationships and then build recipes utilizing that information. E.g Tomatos have a strong connection to Basil, Garlic has a strong connection to olive oil or onions and so on. 

The Rails app handles creation of FoodElements and defining their relationships: There's some simple server-side javascript to enable ajax behaviors. 

There is a related food_index_client ( https://github.com/brianweiner/food_index_client ) built as an angularjs single-page-application. It can create recipes and query for food connections based on an ingredient.
