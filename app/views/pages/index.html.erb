  <div class="small-12 column">
    <p>This small app was inspired by the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flavor-Bible-Essential-Creativity-Imaginative/dp/0316118400/" target="_blank">The Flavor Bible</a> by Karen Page and Andrew Dornenburg.</p>
    <p>Their book features an exhaustive listing of foods, flavors, cuisines, techniques, and beverages that enhance or compliment each other. Having been a long-time fan of Alton Brown's amazing show, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com%2Fshows%2Fgood-eats.html">Good Eats</a>, this book truly spoke to me. It allows you to go beyond "what recipe should I make" to "what ingredients should I use to maximize this dish's flavor".</p>
    <p>Although it is an excellent resource, the fact remains that as a physical book it had limitations that prevent the information within from being utilized to the fullest extent possible: flipping through pages with flour covered fingers gets old pretty quickly!</p>
    <p>I decided that what the data really needed was an app to fully empower it. A search behavior to find items quickly, hyperlinks to jump between related elements, autogenerated wikipedia search links to gather more information about obscure ingredients, and more. </p>
    <p>On the roadmap:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A recipe generator powered by the Flavor Bible allowing even novice cooks to build interesting recipes all on their own, instead of making the same old Bobby Flay knockoffs (<a href="www.foodnetwork.com%2Fshows%2Fthrowdown-with-bobby-flay.html">no offense intended for Mr Flay who has been known to come to peoples' homes and embarass them in front of their friends and family</a>). </li>
      <li>Hopefully integration with Amazon Echo, "Alexa, list ingredients that go with basil"</li>
      <li>Improved usage of single table inheritance to allow separation of behaviors and increased logic for varying types of food elements</li>
      <li>FYI: Only a small amount of the ingredients from the book have been loaded so as not to infringe on the copyrights of Ms. Page and Mr Dornenburg</li>
    </ul>
